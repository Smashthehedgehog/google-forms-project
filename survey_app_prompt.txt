I want you to create a survey creation application where the administrator can sign-in to their survey creation application, they can create a survey, and then they can send that surcey out as a sharable link. 

This will be a page. The user will first go to the lanfing screen, which will be a log-in screen. This page will use Amazon Congnito for the user to input their credentials in the frontend and send them to Congnito. This is how the user will gain access to the home screen. The app should redirect to this page if the user is not logged in yet.

The home screen will be a page. It will contain all of the surveys that have been created (the surveys will be pulled from a DynamoDB table), and an additional button that allows the user to create a new survey. The user can also click on a previosuly created survey and it will give the option to either show the results or delete the survey. Those options should not do anything for now. They should just appear in the frontend. 

Now when the user presses the button that allows them to create a new survey, they will be sent to a survey creation page. In this page, the user can give the survey a name. They can also add questions to the survey. In the question, there will be an input for the question, and the ability to choose between checkmarks (for multiple choices) and boxes (for one choice). They can also add as many options as they want for that question. Similarly, they can also add as many questions as they want for that survey. There should also be a button to save the survey, in which the survey and its questions should be saved to the backend database somewhere (whether it be DynamoDB or something else). Once they finish creating the survey, there should be a create survey button. Once clicked, it should generate a sharable link that the user can give to others. When others open that link, it takes them to the survey with no editing options. All they can do is answer the questions and press submit. When all of the required fields have been filled in, the submit button will work. It should send the response to the database somewhere. There can be a data table per survey and a table that holds all of the survey names.

For the frontend, React should be used. Use Tailwind CSS and shadCN UI for components too. For the backend, Amazon Cognito, API calls, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB can be used. S3 Buckets as well if necessary. You can decide what the best route is for backend.

Before you write any code. I want you to explain to me exactly what I am creating in detail. Explain the steps needed to create this application. Identify what tools, libraries, and other elements that are needed to create this Full Stack application. When you do write the code, make it scalable, easy to understand, and easy to edit so I can go and make changes if necessary. Document all of your code. Ensure every variable and function has clear documentation to indicate what it is used for and why we are using it. As a reminder, the output for this prompt should just be a detailed description of the Tech stack and everything that will be needed, as well as a detailed description of the app itself and what it is supposed to do. Create a markdown file with all of this information. After that is done, we can begin diving into code, but not now.
